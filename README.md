# Procedural-Terrain-Heightmap-Generator
Python-based heightmap generator for procedural terrain, intended to be used by applications such as GIS for synthetic terrain creation.

## Features
- Generates a terrain heightmap in the form of raster data using a technique heavily inspired by Minecraft's terrain generation algorithm.
- Utilizes a stack of cellular automata and perlin noise to generate the heightmap.
- Suitable for generating 3D terrain in various applications, such as ArcGIS Pro.
